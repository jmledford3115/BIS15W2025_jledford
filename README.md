# Welcome to My GitHub Page! 🎉

Hi there! 👋 I'm a professor at **UC Davis**, and this GitHub page is where I share my work for **BIS 15L**—a class dedicated to exploring the intersection of biology, data, and programming. 🌱💻

## What You’ll Find Here

This repository is home to the labs and assignments that arepart of BIS 15L. 

## About BIS 15L

In **BIS 15L**, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of data science with emphasis on data frequently used by biologists. We will use the R software environment to develop and practice key skills including data management, transformation, analysis, and visualization. Practical examples will span a range of disciplines including social science, ecology, evolution, and genetics. Labs will use a problem-solving approach where students build on previously learned skills culminating in a small, group-based project presented at the end of the quarter.

This class is designed for students with no background in computer programming, R, or statistics. My assumption is that you know how to turn a computer on and use a mouse- that’s it! 🧬✨
